DAX measures used for this analysis are:

1\. 

Peak vs OffPeak Difference = 

VAR Peak = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('vw\_peak\_vs\_offpeak'\[AvgDelayMinutes]), 'vw\_peak\_vs\_offpeak'\[TimePeriod] = "Morning Peak" || 'vw\_peak\_vs\_offpeak'\[TimePeriod] = "Evening Peak")

VAR OffPeak = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('vw\_peak\_vs\_offpeak'\[AvgDelayMinutes]), 'vw\_peak\_vs\_offpeak'\[TimePeriod] = "Off-Peak")

RETURN

Peak - OffPeak

**Purpose:**

Calculates how much higher the average delay is during peak hours compared to off-peak hours.

**Used for:** Peak vs Off-Peak Bar Chart KPI.


2\. 

Worst Performing Station = 

VAR \_topStation =

&nbsp;   TOPN(

&nbsp;       1,

&nbsp;       SUMMARIZE('vw\_top\_stations', 

&nbsp;           'vw\_top\_stations'\[Station],

&nbsp;           "TotalDelays", SUM('vw\_top\_stations'\[TotalDelays])

&nbsp;       ),

&nbsp;       \[TotalDelays],

&nbsp;       DESC

&nbsp;   )

RETURN

&nbsp;   MAXX(\_topStation, 'vw\_top\_stations'\[Station])



**Purpose:**

Finds the station with the highest number of total delay incidents.

**Used for:** Card visualization showing “Worst Performing Station.”



I used a calculated column which is as follows:

DelaySeverity = 

SWITCH(

&nbsp;   TRUE(),

&nbsp;   VALUE(\[Min\_Delay]) <= 5, "Minor (0-5)",

&nbsp;   VALUE(\[Min\_Delay]) <= 10, "Moderate (6-10)",

&nbsp;   "Severe (10+)"

)



**Purpose:**

Categorizes each delay event based on duration to simplify visual filtering and analysis.

**Used for:** Stacked column chart by severity category.
